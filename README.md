**About the Project**

This is an adaptive, responsive and interactive webpage that shows you all different places that the user have been. Using a grid layout structure all of the pictures are uploaded in an order very similar to a social media page (ie. Instagram). Just like Instagram or other social media's, such as Facebook, you can add captions to the pictures on your page to show viewers where the picture was taken. Using Javascript we can use the edit profile button to edit the name and the about me description, making it unique to every user. Using Javascript techniques, the user can also click the + button to add pictures to the page, and click the trash can button to delete any pictures they do not wish to share on their page. As a viewer of the webpage, to show your appreciation, you can also "like" the beautiful pictures by clicking on the hearts located next to the name of where the picture was taken.
